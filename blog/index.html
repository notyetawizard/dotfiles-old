<h2>About</h2>

<p>Hey. Welcome. This is a place I made up and am making up entirely for my own sake. You're welcome to hang out here too as long as you keep things tidy and don't make too much noise. What do we do here? I dunno. Just whatever and such</p>

<p>Me? I go by <em>notyetawizard</em>, at least for now. No, that's not my legal name; I'm not not really interested in legality anyway—in fact, I'm an <a href="needslink">anarchist</a>. What else would you like to know? I'm <a href="needslink">agender</a>, have a <a href="needslink">schizoid</a> personality, score as <a href="needslink">INTP</a> on the Jung/MBTI/Keirsey scale, and am contrarian by nature—or it can seem that way, but I'm actualy just interested in truth and am more inclined towards linguistic and logical precision than most people; I like being corrected as much as I like correcting, and argue with my self more than anyone.</p>

<p>I'm a <a href="needslink">transhumanist</a>, and like robots and space and stuff. I do have an aversion to the absurd meat-bodies humans currently live in, and will be getting out of mine the moment a better option comes my way. I also really like the <a href="needslink">cyberpunk</a> aesthetic. </p>

<p>Interested in knowing something else? <a href="needslink">Just ask</a>!</p>

<h2>Blog</h2>

<p>There's not much here right now, of course. I'm really just starting out.</p>

<p>I do intend to do some regular microblogging, and some significantly less regular macroblogging. </p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p><strong>Why is your website so bad?</strong> <br />
Honestly, I like it this way. I'm tired of the overly commercialized internet where everything looks good but is just a way to sell you something, and I'd much rather see people taking their information and networking back into their own hands; a hacked together website you made yourself means a hell of a lot more.</p>

<p>I made made my own hat too.</p>

<p><strong>So, what exactlly do you do?</strong> <br />
All sorts of stuff! I usually just think though.</p>
